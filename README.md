# Transportation and Logistics Analysis for a Freight Company  
The goal of this project is to analyze the transportation and logistics data for a national freight company and create a Power BI dashboard to help stakeholders monitor delivery performance, operational costs, and fleet management. This involves generating realistic data, designing and populating a MySQL database, and developing an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

# Project Overview
This project is divided into three main steps:

1. Generate Data and Design Database
2. Set Up Database in MySQL
3. Create Dashboard in Power BI
   
# Step 1: Generate Data and Design Database
Generate Data
I used Python to generate realistic data for various aspects of the freight company's operations. This includes:

1. Customers
2. Fleet Details
3. Drivers
4. Routes
5. Shipments
6. Delivery Times
7. operational Costs
8. Maintenance Records

# Step 2: Set Up Database in MySQL
I create the database and tables in MySQL and then import the generated data into these tables. This involves:

Creating the database schema,
Defining the relationships between tables,
Writing SQL scripts to populate the tables with the generated data.
Step 3: Create Dashboard in Power BI
Connect Database
We connect the MySQL database to Power BI using the MySQL connector.

# Build Dashboard
I developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to display key logistics metrics, including:

1.Delivery Performance: Visualizations showing on-time deliveries, average delivery times, and delays.
2.Operational Costs: Charts and graphs displaying fuel costs, maintenance costs, and other operational expenses.
3.Fleet Utilization: Metrics on vehicle usage, capacity utilization, and maintenance schedules.
4.Driver Performance: Performance metrics for drivers, including delivery times and customer feedback.

Here is the screenshot of Dashboard
