# Transportation and Logistics Analysis for a Freight Company  
The goal of this project is to analyze the transportation and logistics data for a national freight company and create a Power BI dashboard to help stakeholders monitor delivery performance, operational costs, and fleet management. This involves generating realistic data, designing and populating a MySQL database, and developing an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

# Project Overview
This project is divided into three main steps:

1. Generate Data and Design Database
2. Set Up Database in MySQL
3. Create Dashboard in Power BI
   
# Step 1: Generate Data and Design Database
Generate Data
I used Python to generate realistic data for various aspects of the freight company's operations. This includes:

Customers: Data on customers, including customer ID, name, contact information, and address.
Fleet Details: Data on the vehicles in the fleet, including vehicle ID, type, capacity, and maintenance history.
Drivers: Data on the drivers, including driver ID, name, license number, and performance metrics.
Routes: Data on routes, including route ID, origin, destination, distance, and estimated time.
Shipments: Data on individual shipments, including shipment ID, customer ID, origin, destination, weight, dimensions, and route ID.
Delivery Times: Data on the delivery times for each shipment, including shipment ID, pickup time, delivery time, and any delays.
Operational Costs: Data on costs associated with transportation, including fuel costs, maintenance costs, and other operational expenses.
Maintenance Records: Records of maintenance activities for each vehicle, including maintenance ID, vehicle ID, date, type of maintenance, and cost.
